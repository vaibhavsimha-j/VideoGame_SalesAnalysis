# VideoGame_SalesAnalysis
This repository contains 15 real-world data analysis problem statements based on video game sales datasets. The solutions demonstrate data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation using Python.
The project highlights exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills applied to entertainment industry data, making it a great intermediate-level portfolio project for aspiring data analysts.

## Problem Domains

The repository covers the following areas:
	•	Sales Analysis → Identifying top-selling games, publishers, and platforms
	•	Regional Insights → North America, Europe, Japan, and global comparisons
	•	Trends → Year-wise sales patterns, platform popularity over time
	•	Genre Popularity → Most profitable and popular genres across markets
	•	Publisher Performance → Market dominance and contribution to global sales
	•	Correlation Checks → Linking reviews, genres, and regions with sales performance

 ## Key Problem Statements (Highlights)
 
  •	Cleaning and standardizing sales data for analysis
	•	Ranking games by global and regional sales
	•	Visualizing sales trends across years and platforms
	•	Comparing the popularity of different game genres
	•	Analyzing publishers with the highest contribution to global sales
	•	Identifying regional market differences (NA vs EU vs JP)
	•	Correlating genre/platform with sales success

## Dataset Files  
The dataset files are available in the dedicated `Dataset` branch of this repository.  
Switch to that branch to access raw datasets used for analysis.

## Power BI Visualization Files 
Power BI dashboards and reports are available in the `PowerBI-Visualization` branch.

## Tech Stack
  •	Python
	•	Pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation
	•	Matplotlib → Data visualization

## Repo Structure
